        The framework for the development of a spreadsheet- based financial
        model is illustrated by using a simple concrete example. A spreadsheet
        is used in order to calculate the funding needs of a 2/10 net 3 0 credit
        policy on a certain turnover. The inputs and the output of the mod el
        are defined. Building this model is relatively straightforward. The mode
        l-builder needs to input estimates for certain items (i.e. turnover) and
        th en make sure that the mathematical formulae are correct. From this
        simple b ase, the steps of the financial modelling process are described
        in order to build sophisticated and interconnected models for the income
        statement, ba lance sheet, and cash-flow statement, as well as
        "good/bad/base=E2 =80=9D scenarios that can be changed with a
        simple click or two. This abili ty of spreadsheets to deal with a lot of
        numbers, work with them, and produ ce answers is stressed, as well as
        the use of Excel as the ideal tool for f inancial modelling.

        <h2><a id="c01_level1_1"></a>1.1 WHAT IS FINANCIAL MODELLING?</h2>
        <p>
          If you Google the term "financial model" you will get
          ap proximately 350 million hits. Yes, that's right. Financial
          modelling has be come the single most important skill-set for the
          =C2=ADaspiring finance pro fessional. But what exactly is a financial
          model and what does financial mo delling do? <i>Investopedia</i
          ><sup>1</sup> defines financial modelling as the process by which a
          firm constructs a financial representation of some, or all, aspects of
          it. The model is usually characterized by performing cal culations,
          and makes recommendations based on that information. Moreover,
          <i>Moneyterms</i><sup>2</sup> defines a financial model as anything
          that is used to calculate, forecast, or estimate financial numbers.
          Models can range from simple formulae to complex computer programs
          that may take hours to run. Finally, according to
          <i>Wikipedia</i>,<sup>3</sup> financial modellin g is the task of
          building an abstract representation (a model) of a real-world
          financial situation. This is a mathematical model designed to
          represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial
          asset.<span type="pagebreak" title="4" id="Page_4"> </span> Similar
          definitions ex ist on other financial websites like
          <a href="http://businessdictionary.com">BusinessDictionary.com</a>,
          <i>Divestopedia</i>, etc. Financial modelling is a general term that
          means different things to different people. In t he context of this
          book it relates to accounting and corporate finance appl ications and
          usually involves the preparation of detailed company-specific models
          used for decision-making purposes and financial analysis. While ther e
          has been some debate in the industry as to the nature of financial
          modell ing- whether it is a tradecraft, such as welding, or a
          science -the task of financial modelling has been gaining
          acceptance and rigour over the years.

          Financial models can differ widely in complexity and application: some
          are simple 1-page sheets built to get a "quick-
          and-dirty" estimate of next year's net income. Some span more
          than 40 worksheets and project various scenarios of the value of a
          company.

        <p id="c01-para-0005">
          Although financial models vary in scope and use, many share common
          characteristics. For example:

            <b>Projecting future years for the 3 main financial statements</b>
            -the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash
            flow statement- is typically the first step. Income
            statement estimates for EBIT DA and interest expense as well as
            balance sheet leverage statistics such a s debt/equity and interest
            coverage are often the most important model outp uts.

            More often profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios are
            calculat ed in order to pinpoint any weaknesses in the financial

          Accounting Principl es (GAAP) and the statutory accounting principles.
          They must know how the 3 financial statements work and how these are

          <a id="c01_level1_2"></a>1.2 DEFINING THE INPUTS AND THE OUTPUTS OF A
          SIMPLE FINANCIAL MODEL
        </h2>
        <p>
          A good model is easily recognizable. It has clearly identifiable
          outputs based on clearly defined inputs and the relationship between
          them can be t racked through a logical audit trail. Consider the
          following situation. Thi nk of a wholesale company that wants to use a
          financial model to assess the financial implications of its credit
          policy. Let us say that the company h as a 2-term trade credit
          agreement. In this agreement it offers a discount to its buyers if
          payment is made within a certain period, which is typicall y shorter
          than the net payment period. For example, a "2/10 net 30
          " agreement would give the buyer a discount of 2% if payment
          is rea lized by the 10th day following =C2=ADdelivery. If the buyer
          fails to take advantage of the discount, there are still 20 additional
          days in which to p ay the full price of the goods without being in
          default, that is, the net p eriod has a total duration of 30 days.
          Finally, as with net terms, the comp any could charge penalties if the
          buyer still fails to meet the payment aft er the net term has expired.
          It is expected that 30% of the company's buyer s would adopt the
          discount. Trade credit can be an attractive source of fun ds due to
          its simplicity and convenience. However, trade credit is like a l oan
          by the company to its customer. There are 2 issues associated with
          loan s: (a) what is the necessary amount of the loan and (b) what is
          the cost of it?
        </p>
        <p id="c01-para-0017">
          Therefore, the company needs to build a model in or der to estimate:
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
          <li>
            the cost of the trade credit it provides to its customers, and
          </li>
          <li>
            the funding impact of it, on the basis that 70% of the company's
            custom ers will not adopt the discount,
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>given that it has an annual turnover of =E2=82=AC10,000,000.</p>
        <p id="c01-para-0018">So the model outputs should look like this:</p>
        <figure>
          <table style="border: 1">
            <tr>
              <td class="left"><b>Cost of the Discount</b></td>

          This cost is really high and means that the company offering the
          discount is short of cash. Under normal circumstances it coul d get a
          bank loan much more cheaply than this. On the buyer side, as long a s
          they can obtain a bank loan at a lower interest rate, they would be
          bette r off borrowing at the lower rate and using the cash proceeds of
          the loan t o take advantage of the discount offered by the company.
          Moreover, the amou nt of the discount also represents a cost to the
          company because it does no t receive the full selling price for the
          product. In our case this cost is:

          So far you may have the impression that financial m odelling is purely
          maths and finance. However, for a model to be effective, precise
          financial calculations are not enough and are only part of the equ
          ation. The second and equally important part is the appropriate
          application of subjectivity. Financial models that combine both maths
          and art become t he models that are relevant and are actually used in
          business.<sup>9</sup> In this direction we have used a common style
          for the headings of both the inputs and the outputs. Moreover we could
          have used blue colour for the inp uts. We have used 3 columns to
          separate the particular inputs from their re levant unit of measure
          (UOM) and their proposed value. We started by defini ng first
          <i>the outputs</i> of the model that will answer the business ques
          tion the model will need to address. Then we identified any additional
          info rmation required in order to complete the model (i.e. the cost of
          funds/deb t for the company). Only then did we write down all the
          particular formulae and calculations that the model needs to perform.
        </p>
        <p id="c01-para-0037">
          As a final note to this specific modelling exercise , we mentioned
          previously that there was no need for any decision making. T he model
          was constructed simply to enhance the business understanding of a
          particular company policy. Should any decision need to be taken about
          which credit policy is more efficient, we could model a number of
          different scen arios each with various credit policies. For example we
          could examine 3 dif ferent policies (2/10 net 30, 2/10 net 45, and
          2/10 net 60) in order to cho ose the most favourable one.

            Financial modelling is used, as we mentioned previously, in order to
            sol ve various problems. The first step of the process includes
            teams or indivi duals asking the right questions at the start of the
            problem-solving proces s. This is sometimes hard to believe as it
            often seems that people are tryi ng to solve a problem before they
            have properly defined it. Asking the righ t questions helps break
            down the problem into simpler constituents.

          <h3>1.3.2 Step 2: Specification of the Model</h3>
          <p>
            Now we have identified the variables of the problem, we need a solid
            and thorough specification for a successful financial modelling
            process. The m ajor assumptions should be documented and organized
            by category (such as ma rket prices, sales volumes, costs, credit
            terms, payment terms, capital exp enditures, and so on). All
            assumptions should be placed separately on a sin gle sheet so that
            we do not have to hunt through formulae to figure out whe re a
            number came from.
          </p>
          <p id="c01-para-0044">
            Moreover, the specification of the model, depending on the problem
            we have to address, might include the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To formulate the standard financial statements, including the
              income st atement, =C2=ADbalance sheet, and statement of cash
              flow. For the problem d escribed in Step 1, the balance sheet and
              cash-flow statements are used to determine the level of additional
              borrowing, although they are more time co nsuming than a plain
              income statement, provided that the new product develo pment will
              be funded by debt. The interest expense of this borrowing is an
              expense line in the income statement that we need to forecast in
              order to a nswer the original question. In other cases, i.e. where
              a valuation is requ ired, we would have to derive both the free
              cash flow and the Weighted Aver age Cost of Capital schedules as

          <h3>1.3.3 Step 3: Designing and Building the Model</h3>
          <p>
            Designing and building the financial model is the next phase of the
            proc ess. The specifi=C2=ADcation phase (Step 2) should lay out the
            structure of the model in detail. In this step we first identify the
            <i>outputs</i> of the model. It is good practice to present the
            output of the model on a sepa rate sheet. This output sheet is a
            combination of model inputs and formulae and should read directly
            from the <i>workings</i> sheet of the model. Ther e may be more than
            one output sheet in case the resolution of step 1 requir es the
            handling of uncertainty and creating sensitivity =C2=ADanalyses. Mor
            eover, the control panel described in the specification part of the
            modelli ng process, if any, is part of the output of the model. Next
            we build the <i>assumptions</i> sheet that forms the
            <i>inputs</i> to our model. If our m odel needs past data to build
            on, i.e. historic financial statements, we co llect them and adjust
            them to the right level of detail. Depending on the p roblem we have
            to solve we will not need all of the income statement, balan ce
            sheet, and cash flow statement accounts, and thus some will need to
            be g rouped together. Finally we build the <i>workings</i> or
            <i>calculation she ets</i> and fill their cells with formulae. Thus,
            the sheets where the calc ulations are taking place should always be
            separate from both the input and the output sheets.<span
              type="pagebreak"
              title="12"
              id="Page_12"
            ></span>
            Also no hard-coded values should be typed directly into the calcu
            lations of the workings sheet. In case the purpose of the model is
            to forec ast future financial statements, all the relevant key
            drivers of the histor ic financial statements are calculated and
            forecast into the future. The fo recast key drivers will make the
            building blocks of the future financial st atements as we will see
            in Chapter 3 where we will build a financial model from scratch in
            order for the reader to grasp all the aforementioned abstra ct
            rules.
          </p>
          <p id="c01-para-0047">
            The following indicate best practices that will hel p you build
            models that are robust, easy to use, easy to understand, and pa
            inless to update. Best practices are of greatest concern when
            documents are used by more than one person:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use a modular design to divide your model into sections such as:
              Docume ntation, Data, Assumptions/Inputs, Workings, and Outputs,
              as we have alread y mentioned above. The first sheet of the model
              should serve as a user guid e, step-by-step documentation as to
              how the model works. It may seem time-c onsuming, but it greatly
              increases the productivity of the whole team, and frees up time
              when, at a later stage, as you try to remember how you built the
              model, you will need to revise it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always avoid hard-coding numbers into formulae and try to keep
              your for mulae as short as possible. Always split complex formulae
              into multiple, si mple steps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use formatting for description rather than decoration. For example
              use different colour text for assumptions compared with formulae
              and output res ults. Use consistency in colours (e.g. blue for
              inputs) to highlight cells where data must be entered. When using
              more colours do not forget to add a legend explaining what each
              colour means. Always keep in mind the KISS prin ciple: Keep It
              Simple Stupid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Present the data as clearly and in as uncluttered a form as
              possible. A lways separate inputs into at least 3 columns, one
              with the particular inpu ts, the second describing the Units of
              Measure (UOM) of each input, and the last one with the values of
              each input.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you distribute your model to others, do protect it to prevent
              inadve rtent changes. By default, anyone can change anything on
              any spreadsheet. To prevent unauthorized changes you should either
              protect your worksheets or your workbook as a whole. As a workbook
              owner you should always keep one copy of your original model in a
              directory that only you can change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designate ownership and track who is changing what. If you decide
              not t o prevent changes in your model then try at least to monitor
              them. To do so you can simply make use of the Track Changes tool
              in Excel 2010 and 2013. Microsoft's Track Changes function allows
              revisions to be made to a documen t and keeps a complete record of
              all changes made. Track Changes can be inv aluable if you have
              created a business document and you =C2=ADdistribute it to others
              to work with it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Design your worksheets to read from left to right and from top to
              botto m, like a European book. This is a common recommendation in
              the literature. Perhaps it is a remnant of paper-based documents,
              but it seems that follow ing such a design does make spreadsheets
              easier to navigate and understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally when incorporating charts in your model, always label the
              axes and use titles.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Although this is not a book on how to build good sp readsheets, the

            find plenty of information and research papers about spreadsheet

            This guide is of interest to anyone who rel ies on decisions from
            spreadsheet models. The techniques described include areas such as
            ensuring that the objectives of the model are clear, defining the
            calculations, good design practice, testing and understanding, and
            pre senting the results from spreadsheet models.

          <h3>1.3.4 Step 4: Checking the Model's Output</h3>
          <p>
            The model is not ready until we ensure that it produces the results
            it w as designed to. Errors in the data or formulae could be costly,
            even devast ating. The received wisdom is that about 5% of all
            formulae in spreadsheet models contain errors, and this rate is
            consistent across spreadsheets. Err ors may occur at the
            functionality level, the logic level, the design level , etc. A
            simple way to check our model is to introduce checks directly in t
            he forms. Some of these checks will be very generic and will
            therefore be i ncluded early. For example in case of a balance sheet
            the obvious check is the sum of assets vs the sum of equity and
            liabilities. In case of a cash f low statement the cash and cash
            equivalents at the beginning of a period sh ould be equal to the
            cash and cash equivalents at the end of the previous p eriod.
            Moreover the cash and cash equivalents at the end of a period should
            be the same as the cash account of the balance sheet of that period.
            Other checks will be more model-specific, and the need for them will
            not be obvi ous at the beginning- therefore, new checks
            will be included throu ghout the model building phase.
          </p>
          <p id="c01-para-0050">
            As a minimum, we can test our model subsequent to t he building
            phase by playing with the inputs and see if this produces reaso
            nable results (reasonableness tests). For example, if a formula is
            supposed to add a set of values then we can test it by providing
            known data, and ch ecking that the answer is the expected one.
            Moreover we can change each of the input parameters and see if the
            output results change accordingly.
          </p>
          <p id="c01-para-0051">
            There is free textbook on Wikibooks (<i
              >Financial M odelling in Microsoft Excel/Testing</i
            >)<sup>11</sup> which provides a deta iled checklist of the best
            practices on how to error-check a spreadsheet. F rom checking its
            functionality, i.e. whether the model does what it is supp osed to
            do, to checking the business logic in the model. From identifying t

            could be, t o checking the inputs of the model and its calculations,
            i.e. examining all formula cells, where they read from, and where
            they feed their result to.
          </p>
          <p id="c01-para-0052">
            Of course there are error-checking tools that can m ake our life
            easier. Excel 2003 and later versions have a built-in error-ch
            ecking tool. For example in Excel 2003 under the Tools menu, just
            select Er ror Checking. If the Excel Error Checking tool detects a
            possible error, it pops up a dialog box. This box gives several
            choices, which range from ign oring the warning to taking action.
            The more updated the version of Excel t he better the error-checking
            tools that have been incorporated. However, th e error-checking
            tools built into Excel are simple but limited. A number of more
            sophisticated error-checking products are available on the market.

          Microsoft Excel is the ideal tool for the kind of modelling covered in
          t his book. Its immense popularity throughout the business world today
          for pr ocessing quantitative data and developing analytical solutions
          is widely ac knowledged. One could argue that it is one of the most
          powerful and most im portant software applications of all time.<span

          were about to vanish and somebody could pass futu re gener=C2=ADations
          a single wonder of our time, this should be Excel. Exc el is
          everywhere you look in the business world- especially in are
          as where people are handling numbers, such as marketing, business
          developme nt, sales, and finance. In a 2011 study, Weiser Mazars found
          that Excel was the favorite tool of insurance finance and accounting.
          Teams relied heavil y on Excel to compensate for shortcomings in the
          information flow. Most lea ders they questioned did not have plans to
          change this process. Moreover, t hey found that 87% of companies rely
          on Excel in their planning, budgeting, and other performance
          management processes.<sup>12</sup> In a different su rvey performed by
          <i>gtnews</i> during 2014 in relation to the technology t hat
          Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&amp;A) professionals are using,
          alm ost three-quarters (73%) of those surveyed indicated that Excel is

          But while Excel is reasonably robust, the spreadshe ets that people
          create with Excel are incredibly fragile. For starters, the re is no
          way to trace where your data came from, there is no audit trail (s o
          you can overtype numbers and not realize it), and there is no easy way
          to test spreadsheets. The biggest problem is that anyone can create
          Excel spr eadsheets- badly. Because it's so easy to use, the
          creation of eve n important spreadsheets is not restricted to people
          who understand program ming and do it in a methodical, well-documented
          way. That is why one should be aware of Excel's limitations. Tim
          Worstall, a <i>Forbes</i> contributor , =C2=ADproclaimed recently in a
          <i>Forbes</i> article that "Micros oft's Excel Might Be The
          Most Dangerous Software on the Planet" aft er JP Morgan's loss
          of several billion dollars due to a spreadsheet error.<sup>14</sup>
          Moreover, a <a href="http://cfo.com/">CFO.com</a> article st ates that
          the error rates in spreadsheets are huge; Excel will dutifully av
          erage the wrong data right down the line and there's no protection
          against that.<sup>15</sup> Finally, an article entitled
          "Beware of the Spre adsheet" appeared in the
          international edition of <i>Accounting and Busines</i>s, in which
          David Parmenter argued that the use of large spread sheets for
          reporting, forecasting, and planning should be abandoned because of
          their susceptibility to errors.<sup>16</sup> Excel is a tool and as
          suc h its use should be underpinned by proper controls as we mentioned
          earlier in this chapter.
        </p>
        <p id="c01-para-0055">
          In this direction both the Switzerland-based Basel Committee on
          Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Services Authorit y (FSA)
          in the UK have recently made it clear that when relying on manual p
          rocesses, desktop applications, or key internal data flow
          =C2=ADsystems suc h as spreadsheets, banks and insurers should have
          effective controls in pla ce that are consistently applied to manage
          risks around incorrect, false, o r even fraudulent data. The citation
          by the BCBS is the first time that spr eadsheet management has ever
          been specifically referenced at such a high le vel, a watermark in the
          approach to spreadsheet risk.

          Readers of this book should bear in mind that, alth ough Excel is an
          incredible tool and without it we would not have had the i ncredible
          financialization of the world economy over the past 30 years, err ors
          can easily happen while trying to model real life situations. Proper
